The principles of agile are fantastic. I've worked on projects that are both waterfall, agile and somewhere in between and, as a developer, I can't sing the praises of *being agile* high enough.

Projects feel more controlled, with less risk, and we *usually* deliver most of what the stakeholder wanted at the end of it all. The authors of the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) got it spot on.

Then we went and ruined it all by giving 'Agile' a capital 'A'.

The verb agile is great. To be *agile* means we can adapt to change, to re-think as necessary for the good of the team. As soon as you turn it into a noun, it allows people to define hard-coded processes where people can say things like 'That isn't how you do it in Agile'.

Scrum is a good example to illustrate my point.


The fact that you can be pay to be a qualified *Scrum Practitioner* bothers me, that formal process just doesn't feel agile to me.


To demonstrate why, let me quote you the last bullet point from the Agile manifesto:

> **Responding to change** over Following a plan

The authors of the Agile Manifesto value 'responding to change' *over* 'following a plan'. This value, I feel, has been corrupted by Agile being treated as a noun, a process, rather than a way of thinking.

This conversation shouldn't happen, yet it all too often does:


> **Developer**: The standup isn't working for us, maybe we should try something else instead
>
> **Business**: We're using Scrum on this project, so we need to stick to this format. We just need to be better at it.


This is, in my opinion, the entire opposite of *being agile*.

Treating any Agile methodology (of which Scrum is just one example) as a fixed process is just at dangerous as Waterfall for a project. In fact, it's worse.

Bad Agile implementations are a silent killer of projects. You can quite happily tick over on a project for months, working your way trough the backlog, while the team slowly gets paralysed by the process.

When I think back to the best projects I've worked on, the team has been given room to shape the process continually as the project has evolved. That's a credit to the project managers who have run those projects and is, in my opinion of course, the true meaning of agile.

Agile is not a process, it's a mindset.


One parting thought. This is the first bullet-point in the Agile Manifesto:


> Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools


I think that says it all.
