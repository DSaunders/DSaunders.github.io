# Time estimates - no thanks



If you’ve been anywhere near Twitter recently, you’ll have seen the #NoEstimates hash-tag is growing in popularity. The NoEstimates camp argue that you don’t need to estimate tasks to run a successful agile project.

Unfortunately that’s not always a possibility. It’s perfectly reasonable for a customer to ask how long something will take, and ‘I have no idea’ is not an acceptable answer. They are, after all, trying to pay you. Nobody in their right mind is going to commit to a project with an unknown timeline and no idea of what their budget should be.


# #No(time)Estimates

If we are going to estimate, let’s **not** use time any more.

Time estimates come with an inherent expectation on behalf of the customer that you will deliver within that timescale. Sure, we can try to educate the customer that these are *estimates*, but why make it hard on ourselves in the first place?

Time estimates put unnecessary pressure on developers. I don’t want to be in the position where I have to make a choice between  cutting corners, or delivering a feature ‘late’ in the eyes of a project manager or customer.

Finally, time estimates are *always* wrong. We are terrible at estimating lengthy tasks.


# What do we use instead?

If we must estimate (and we’ve already decided we must), let’s use something like story-points instead.

Story point estimates are where we assign an arbitrary value to a task, to reflect how difficult and time consuming we think it will be *relative to other tasks*. This could be number from the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5 8 etc..) or simply t-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large etc.).

It is much easier for us to estimate one task’s relative complexity in relation to another’s using this system. For example, if we estimate that changing some text on the home page is a ‘1’, then swapping out the database implementation is maybe an ‘8’. There is no inherent expectation that this task will take me ’12 hours’.

# But what about the customer?

Of course, we can’t say to a customer ‘this project is 150 points’. That won’t mean anything to them if they haven’t worked with us before. 

To use story-points to plan projects, we need to measure our *velocity*. This is the average number of story-points we achieve in a sprint.

After the first couple of sprints, we should have a rough idea how many story-points we remove from the backlog in each sprint. That should allow us to forecast approximately how long the rest of the project should take.

If we know the team’s approximate velocity, we can also give the customer an estimate up front of how long the project will take.  We can still give them the time estimate they expect, but it removes the pressure to complete individual tasks in a given time period.



-----------

- esimates help us ask questions about the story
- story points predict how long something will take
- story points != time, but we can get an approximate time from story points (the customer has a right to expect an approximate timscale)
- inherent expectation in time estimates
