  <h2>The problem with Agile is the capital A</h2>
  <p class="meta">Originally posted on 16 Jun 2014</p>

  <span class="post-content">
    <p>The principles of agile are fantastic. I’ve worked on projects that are both waterfall, agile and somewhere in between and, as a developer, I can’t sing the praises of <em>being agile</em> high enough.</p>

<p>Projects feel more controlled, with less risk, and we <em>usually</em> deliver most of what the stakeholder wanted at the end of it all. The authors of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> got it spot on.</p>

<p>Then we went and ruined it all by giving ‘Agile’ a capital ‘A’.</p>

<p>The verb agile is great. To be <em>agile</em> means we can adapt to change, to re-think as necessary for the good of the team. As soon as you turn it into a noun, it allows people to define hard-coded processes where people can say things like ‘That isn’t how you do it in Agile’.</p>

<p>Scrum is a good example to illustrate my point.</p>

<p>The fact that you can be pay to be a qualified <em>Scrum Practitioner</em> bothers me, that formal process just doesn’t feel agile to me.</p>

<p>To demonstrate why, let me quote you the last bullet point from the Agile manifesto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Responding to change</strong> over Following a plan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors of the Agile Manifesto value ‘responding to change’ <em>over</em> ‘following a plan’. This value, I feel, has been corrupted by Agile being treated as a noun, a process, rather than a way of thinking.</p>

<p>This conversation shouldn’t happen, yet it all too often does:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Developer</strong>: The standup isn’t working for us, maybe we should try something else instead</p>

  <p><strong>Business</strong>: We’re using Scrum on this project, so we need to stick to this format. We just need to be better at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, in my opinion, the entire opposite of <em>being agile</em>.</p>

<p>Treating any Agile methodology (of which Scrum is just one example) as a fixed process is just at dangerous as Waterfall for a project. In fact, it’s worse.</p>

<p>Bad Agile implementations are a silent killer of projects. You can quite happily tick over on a project for months, working your way trough the backlog, while the team slowly gets paralysed by the process.</p>

<p>When I think back to the best projects I’ve worked on, the team has been given room to shape the process continually as the project has evolved. That’s a credit to the project managers who have run those projects and is, in my opinion of course, the true meaning of agile.</p>

<p>Agile is not a process, it’s a mindset.</p>

<p>One parting thought. This is the first bullet-point in the Agile Manifesto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that says it all.</p>
